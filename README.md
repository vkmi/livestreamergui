# Livestreamer-gui
A livestreamer gui written in c#, with some addedd goodies like:

- History of watched streams, with titles
- Quick option to select quality
- Quick option to get seekable Twitch VODs
- A field to pass arguments to livestreamer as if using the command line

At the moment quick options and titles in the history work only with Twitch, Twitch VODs and YouTube. 
Any other website compatible with livestreamer works leaving all settings as default.

Requires having Livestreamer already installed [Link](http://docs.livestreamer.io).  
Needs VisualStudio if you want to compile it yourself.  
Requires .Net4.0 framework, so I don't know how it works with Windows versions older than Windows 10, if there is request, I may work on it.
