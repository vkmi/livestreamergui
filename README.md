# Livestreamer-gui
A livestreamer gui I'm mainly doing for myself, written in c#  
At the moment options works only with Twitch, Twitch VODs and YouTube, while default settings should work with any website compatible with livestreamer.

Requires having Livestreamer already installed (duh).  
Needs VisualStudio to be compiled.  
Requires .Net4.0 framework, so I don't know how it works with Windows versions older than Windows 10, if there is request, I may work on it.
