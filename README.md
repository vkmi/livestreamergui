# Livestreamer-gui
A livestreamer gui I'm mainly doing for myself, written in c#

At the moment it works only with Twitch, Twitch VODs and YouTube.

Requires having Livestreamer already installed (duh).
Needs VisualStudio to be compiled.
Requires .Net4.0 framework, so I don't know how it works with Windows versions older than Windows10
If there is request, I may work on it.
